# Introduction

## Welcome to the Lucia Documentation!

Lucia is a simple programming language designed with beginners in mind. It emphasizes readability, ease of use, and a gentle learning curve, making it the perfect choice for those just getting started with programming.

## Key Features
- **Simple Syntax**: Lucia's syntax is designed to be clean and easy to understand, making it ideal for new programmers.
- **Customizable**: Lucia allows developers to extend and modify the language according to their needs, giving you flexibility in your projects.
- **Interactive REPL**: Lucia includes an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that allows you to experiment and test code snippets in real time, speeding up the learning process.

## Getting Started
To get started with Lucia, you'll first need to install the language on your machine. Follow the instructions in the 
[Installation Guide](./installation-guide.md) to set up your development environment. Once installed, you can try your 
first program by following the "Hello, World!" tutorial in the [Getting Started](./language-syntax.md#getting-started) section.

## Hello World Example
Here's a simple "Hello, World!" in Lucia REPL:

```lucia-repl
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```

We hope you enjoy coding with Lucia! We're excited to see what amazing things you'll create with it!
