  <p>A lightweight, expressive scripting language with Python-like syntax, built in Rust.</p>
</div>

---

**Lucia** is designed to be clean, expressive, and simple to learn —  
yet powerful and fast enough for serious scripting. It draws inspiration from *Python*, *Lua*, and *Kotlin*,  
and is implemented entirely in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Original_Ferris.svg" alt="Rust" style="height:1em; vertical-align: text-bottom;"> Rust</a> for performance and safety.
